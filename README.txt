This is the Nordic Melee Netplay Build auto-patcher.

The purpose of this executable is to take you from any version of the Nordic Melee Netplay Build or vanilla
PAL ISO to the latest version of the Nordic Melee Netplay Build.

Usage: Simple drag and drop your vanilla PAL ISO or NMNB ISO onto the bat file named "DROPYOURISOHERE.bat"
If everything goes well, the utility will download info on what patches are available and generate a new ISO
file for you that is the latest version.

If things do go wrong, contact Zaik in the Nordic Melee Netplay group or email him at jonatan.waern@gmail.com
with the error message and he'll get back to you as soon as he can.
