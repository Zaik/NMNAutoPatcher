This is the Nordic Melee Netplay Build auto-patcher.

The purpose of this executable is to take you from any version of the Nordic Melee Netplay Build or vanilla
PAL ISO to the latest version of the Nordic Melee Netplay Build.

Usage: Move your current vanilla PAL ISO or NMNB ISO into the same directory you extracted the .rar from,
then simply drag and drop your ISO onto the bat file named "DROPYOURISOHERE.bat".
If everything goes well, the utility will download info on what patches are available and generate a new ISO
file for you that is the latest version.

(Mac/Linux/Cross-platform notes: run the script from the command line, like this:
./patch_iso_crossplatform.py '/path/to/Super Smash Bros Melee.iso'
You need to have python3 and xdelta3 installed)

If things do go wrong, contact Zaik in the Nordic Melee Netplay group or email him at jonatanwaern@gmail.com
with the error message and he'll get back to you as soon as he can.
